# Dolphin Image Detection (Yolo)

This repository is dedicated to the detection of dolphins in camera images. It consists of two folders:

1. Variance based with thresholding methods (unsuccessful) : 
    This folder contains the code for variance-based detection of dolphins in images. It utilizes variance-based algorithms to identify regions of interest that are likely to contain dolphins. However, this approach was not successful in achieving satisfactory results. The code includes various techniques such as adaptive thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection.

2. Finetune YOLO : 
    This folder contains the code for fine-tuning the YOLO v5 object detection model specifically for dolphin detection. It provides instructions and code for training the model on dolphin image datasets to improve its accuracy and performance. The code includes data preprocessing, model configuration, training, and evaluation steps.

The goal of the code in this folder is to develop an accurate and efficient dolphin video detection system.


To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
``cd /users/zfne/emanuell/Documents/GitHub/Dolphins/Dolphin_image_detection\ \(Yolo\)/``
2. Install requirements
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
