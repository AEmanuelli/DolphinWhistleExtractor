## Web Interface for Video Classification

This folder contains the work aimed at developing a web interface that allows people to classify extracted videos. It consists of two main sections:

1. Best Webpage: This folder contains the code for the final webpage, which is considered the best implementation. It uses Nextcloud as a host for the files and serves them correctly.
  - [Dolphins Webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/dolphinstest/)
  - [Delfin Webpage on German Site](https://www.zebrain.bio.ens.psl.eu/delfin/)

2. Aborted Ideas: This folder contains the work that was left aside during the development process. It includes different subfolders with code related to Amazon Web Service hosting, Nextcloud using API, videoplayer with Flask, videoplayer with JavaScript, and videoplayer without backend.
