# Dolphins

This repository contains the code and documentation for my internship at German Sumbre's lab on dolphin communication.

## Introduction

The internship focuses on using computational methods to analyze and leverage the large amount of data available in the lab. The goal is to refine our understanding of the way bottlenose dolphins communicate.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into various folders, each containing its own README file and requirements.txt file.

## Folder Structure

- `DNN_whistle_detection`: This folder contains the code and documentation for the DNN whistle detection part of the project.
- `Dolphin_image_detection (Yolo)`: This folder contains the code and documentation for the dolphin image detection part of the project.
- `Web_interface`: This folder contains the code and documentation for the web interface part of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please refer to the README file in each folder for specific instructions and the requirements.txt file in each folder for the dependencies. Alternatively, you can install the dependencies listed in the root requirements.txt file.

I utilized a Python 3.9.18 conda environment, that I created right inside the Dolphins folder on each machine after git cloning the project.
